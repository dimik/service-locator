/**
 * @fileOverview
 * Simple javascript implementation of the Service Locator.
 * Service Locator is a kind of dependency injection pattern.
 * The Service Locator pattern does not describe how to instantiate the services.
 * It describes a way to register services and locate them.
 * A Service Locator should be able to locate a service without knowing its concrete type.
 * For example, it might use a string key.
 * This allows you to replace the concrete implementation of the dependency without modifying the classes.
